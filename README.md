# Diddly Doodly Dow!

At lunchtime i bought a huge orange  
the size of it made us all laugh  
i peeled it and shared it with robert and dave  
they got quarters and i had a half  

and that orange it made me so happy  
as ordinary things often do  
just lately, the shopping, a walk in the park  
this peace and contemptment is new  

the rest of the day was quite easy  
did all of the jobs oin mt list  
and enjoyed them and had some time over  
i love you, im glad i exist.  

the orange, wendy cope
